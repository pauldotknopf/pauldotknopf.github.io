      <description>In my current project, we are going to require a great deal of native code due to interation with drivers and hardware. The application is going to be based in .NET, at least the UI portion, but the heart has to live in native C++.
I began investigating different ways to interop with .NET and unmanaged code. There seems to be three approaches.
 PInvoke COM/COM+/Interop C++/CLI  I did not look into the PInvoke method because I know that it will not be suitable for my needs.</description>

      <description>What I do I am a software engineer for a medical device company building products on many platforms. From front-end web applications, to embedded Linux devices, and everything in between.
Why I do it My first webpage was a geocities page. I would scan through gifs/stickers and absolutely position (drag-and-drop) them all over my home page, add random javascript snippets for fancy tickers and blinking colors, etc. I channeled my passion into developing an &amp;ldquo;actual&amp;rdquo; website.</description>
