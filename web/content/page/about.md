## What I do

I am a software engineer for a medical device company building products on many platforms. From front-end web applications, to embedded Linux devices, and everything in between.

## Why I do it

My first webpage was a geocities page. I would scan through gifs/stickers and absolutely position (drag-and-drop) them all over my home page, add random javascript snippets for fancy tickers and blinking colors, etc. I channeled my passion into developing an "actual" website. I chose Visual Basic, since it seemed like english, and started developing my first ASP.NET 2.0 website.

The creative excitement it gave me has never really died. It has driven me across multiple operating systems, languages and tech stacks.
